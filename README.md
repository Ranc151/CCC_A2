In this project, we used Flask as the back-end framework and imported RESTful as the API interface design style. For the front-end we chose to separate from the back-end to make it easier to develop and manage, and Vue was our choice.

We get our data from three main sources, the first is the twitter file, the second is the data from the SUDO website, and the third is the data from MASTODON real-time crawling.We mainly divide cities according to the region, and compare the differences in various aspects of each city based on the name of the city.
